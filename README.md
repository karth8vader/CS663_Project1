# Teaching Children Sign Language 

Karthikeyan Vijayaraj

Sign language is an important skill that can benefit everyone, not just people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Teaching children sign language at an early age can make communication more inclusive and help build understanding across different communities. This project will use computer vision to create a tool that helps children learn sign language in an interactive way, giving them real-time feedback on their gestures. By making sign language easier to learn and more engaging, the goal is to encourage wider use of signing skills and support a society where communication is more accessible to all.
